<Project is for _eductaional_ purposes only> 
An attempt to create clear and transparent credit enviorment through contracts for data aggregators, furnishers, brokers, resellers and users. 
Structs could be set up into the logical formats of the major components of the credit file (e.g. personal info, account, loan info) with major imporvements. 
Rules, controls, governance, and permissable purposes could be cleary displayed publicly for all transactions - allowing for citizens and government to audit activities in real time
PII would be ingested and maintained for matching purposed in a highly governed side chain.
Match logic rules would be public to build trust between the counterparties but PII would never be returned in any circumstance, only a match confiedence value and confirmation of which elements it matched on - data minimization is a major issue in the current enviorment
